# airbnb-clone-project
An Airbnb backend clone demonstrating a scalable API with Django and DRF. It uses PostgreSQL, a GraphQL layer, and a Celery/Redis combo for async tasks. Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines ensure a consistent workflow and code quality. This project showcases my proficiency in modern backend development.
