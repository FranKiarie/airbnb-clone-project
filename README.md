# airbnb-clone-project
An Airbnb backend clone demonstrating a scalable API with Django and DRF. It uses PostgreSQL, a GraphQL layer, and a Celery/Redis combo for async tasks. Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines ensure a consistent workflow and code quality. 

Key Technologies:

Django & Django REST Framework: Provides a powerful foundation for building secure and efficient RESTful APIs.

PostgreSQL: Used for reliable and structured data storage.

GraphQL: An alternative API layer for flexible and efficient data querying.

Celery & Redis: Manages asynchronous tasks and provides high-speed caching.

Docker: Ensures a consistent development and deployment environment.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automates testing and deployment for streamlined workflows.

This project is a demonstration of my ability to implement a full-featured backend system using industry-standard tools and practices.


Team Roles
Here are the roles and responsibilities of the project team:

Backend Developer: Writes the server-side logic, API endpoints, and database schemas. They ensure the backend is functional, scalable, and secure.

Database Administrator: Manages the database, including its design, indexing, and optimizations for efficient data storage and retrieval.

DevOps Engineer: Automates the CI/CD pipelines for testing and deployment. They manage the infrastructure using Docker and ensure the services are consistently deployed and monitored.

QA Engineer: Ensures the product meets all quality standards. They create and execute test plans, identify bugs, and verify that all functionalities work correctly before release.
